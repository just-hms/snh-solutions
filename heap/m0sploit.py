# FREE:
# to free a chunk:
# - go back 8 bytes to see the size
# - write the size in the last byte
# - set the prev of the next chunk to 0 (fried)

# add the chunk to the fast bins (double linked list)
# - setting fd and bk
#
# in reality, at the start if prev in use is 0
# - check the size above (size of prev chunk)
# - subtract size and get prev-chunk start
# - remove it from it's fastbin
#   c->fd->bk = c->bk;
#   c->bk->fd = c->fd;
# - write the newsize in the header size*2 and also at the end
